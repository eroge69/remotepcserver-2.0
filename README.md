Original site androidremotepc.com is down so people cant use bluetooth remote pc by Rozky, either free or paid version, because thay cant download the pc side app.
Luckly I still have the file here
[remotepcserver-2.0-win32.zip](https://github.com/eroge69/remotepcserver-2.0/blob/main/remotepcserver-2.0-win32.zip)

Just click view raw, or download raw file

Update: Looks like they are completely out of business. Now I can't even find the app in playstore. So sad :disappointed_relieved:
